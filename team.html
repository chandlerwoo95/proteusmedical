  			<div class="page_collapsible" id="body-section1">Edward Ruppel III - Co-founder, CEO, and Customer Liaison<span></span></div>
  			<div class="container">
    			<div class="content">
        		<p>Eddie has had extensive R&D and device design experience during his consulting time at Ideaboxx and Prescient Surgical, and his knowledge of manufacturing and product design is an invaluable tool that will help devise a marketable product for our team. His experience with prototyping under CAD softwares such as SolidWorks will expedite the design process and allow us to model our device design in a timely manner. Most importantly, his professionalism meshes well as a customer liaison for our project team, as his quick responses and time management have allowed us to stay on schedule with our deliverables.

  			<div class="container">
      			<div class="content">
          		<p>Chandler has considerable background in designing protocols and has worked in several laboratory settings, learning how to refine and optimize methods for the most effective result. His knowledge of anatomy during his time as a Teaching Assistant for Human Anatomy has given him keen insight into physiological systems, of which is translatable towards a canine model. Additionally, the interpersonal skills that he has developed in his time as a TA and at conferences when presenting his research gives him the tools to convey the needs and design considerations of our project in a succinct and clear manner. To that end, Chandler will work on making our product marketable as well as manage finances for the team, while providing input on how to reduce the cost of our project while maintaining its efficacy.</p>

            <p>Connor has extensive laboratory experience working with animals, and his knowledge is fully translatable towards understanding the clinical and ethical considerations when working with animals. Additionally, he has grown up with a dog and has had personal experience when his own dog consumes foreign bodies, giving our team a prime stakeholder perspective on how treatment and the procedures go for veterinary foreign body retrieval. Connor’s keen eye for detail will be important for the validation and quality control of our product, as we aim to improve the functionality of the endoscopic retrieval device for veterinarian use. </p>
