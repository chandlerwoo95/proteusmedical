  				<p>This project was focused on creating a GUI in MATLAB to conduct a hearing test for young children. The algorithm implemented a two-alternative forced choice (2AFC) experiment to determine the decibel hearing range of the subject. Two stimuli were randomly generated, a standard sound and a random noise with a sine-wave tone, and based off the recognition of each sound, an adaptive procedure was used to identify the decibel hearing range. </p>
				<p>The defining feature of this program was to create an interactive environment such that a young child would not be bored. In essence, a reward system was put in place to tell the child whether they identified the correct sound. A 2-down-1-up (2D1U) algorithm was implemented for determining the level of the next sound, which ultimately was used to test how low the subject could hear effectively. </p>

  				<p> This was my first major MATLAB project that implemented a user-interface to run the code. This was a fun project, and though the layout was rudimentary, the algorithm addressed all the requirements successfully in the time given.
