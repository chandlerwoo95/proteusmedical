              			<p>As we wrap up the Fall 2016 semester here at the University of Rochester, our work on this project has all but begun.</p>
				<p>This semester was dedicated towards researching current devices in circulation and understanding how we will be able to make an impact in the endoscopic retrieval device market. We followed a specific set of deadlines to present memos on our research, as well as held brainstorming sessions to develop ideas that would lead to our device design.</p>
				<p>Most importantly, we have coordinated with our customer, Dr. Erika de Papp, where we have identified the important changes that need to be made to create a device that will change the foreign body retrieval game. While we are focusing on veterinary care, we hope that with some further research and development, we will be able to create a device in the Spring that will be translatable for human use. There is limitless potential in this market, and we are excited to see where this project takes us.</p>

His company focuses on reducing the incidence of surgical site infections. We spoke to Jon about what he’s doing.</p>

              	<p>It's been 50 years since Dr. Tom Fogarty invented the catheter-based treatment for blood clots that's now the standard of care. At 80, it would be a cinch for Fogarty to retire to his California vineyard and bask in the reflected glory of his accomplishments.</p>
				<p>But Fogarty, a serial entrepreneur with more than 30 medical device startups under his belt, told MassDevice.com recently that he has no plans to slow down until he's 6 feet under.</p>
				<p>In Part 2 of our 3-part series, Fogarty takes us on a tour of The Fogarty Institute for Innovation, affectionately known as "The Fog Shop."</p>

              	<p>Five startups have been selected to join the incubator program at The Fogarty Institute, an education nonprofit based in Mountain Valley, Calif., that mentors medical innovators.</p>
				<p>Four out of five of these companies–First Pulse Medical, Materna Medical, InPress Technologies and Medical Cue–are attempting to innovate in the maternity/women’s health field.</p>
				<p>President and CEO Ann Fyfe said this is a growing trend, as lots of innovations need to be made but haven’t been, partially due to an environment surrounded by litigation that makes innovators and investors nervous.</p>
				<p>The other one, Prescient Surgical, has two buzz words associated with it: readmissions and wound healing. Fyfe said the woundcare field is growing quickly, especially for those products intended to reduce hospital-acquired infections (in theory limiting hospital stays and readmissions).</p>

					<h3>Making pregnancy safer, one medtech start-up at a time</h3>

              	<p>Not every 79-year-old surgeon happens to run a tech incubator. Not every 79-year-old surgeon who runs a tech incubator happens to have a winery either. But Thomas Fogarty does. The doctor-entrepreneur-vintner, best known for inventing the angioplasty balloon, runs the Thomas Fogarty Winery just a few miles uphill from his medtech incubator at El Camino Hospital in Mountain View.</p>
				<p>The non-profit Fogarty Institute for Innovation is based around a simple concept: Making life easier for small or early stage medtech firms developing cutting-edge products or tools. In an interview with Fast Company, Fogarty decried what he saw as the increasing cost of American medical innovation, and said that small medical companies need a safe environment for growth similar to those of lower-overhead conventional tech startups.</p>
