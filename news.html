              			<p>Prescient Surgical, a Bay Area wound care startup that aims to reduce surgical site infection, has raised about $6 million, according to a regulatory filing.</p>
				<p>The company’s staying pretty vague about the technology’s specifics, but president Jonathon Coe has said the company has “developed a platform technology that integrates fluid delivery with a novel wound retraction and protection system.” It’s undergoing clinical trials.</p>
				<p>Studies have shown that surgical site infection costs about $21,000 on average to treat, increasing hospital stays by about 10 days. While overall about 2 to 5 percent of those undergoing inpatient surgery get these infections, that rate can rise up to 26 percent with abdominal GI operations like colorectal surgery, Prescient said.</p>

              	<p>It's been 50 years since Dr. Tom Fogarty invented the catheter-based treatment for blood clots that's now the standard of care. At 80, it would be a cinch for Fogarty to retire to his California vineyard and bask in the reflected glory of his accomplishments.</p>
				<p>But Fogarty, a serial entrepreneur with more than 30 medical device startups under his belt, told MassDevice.com recently that he has no plans to slow down until he's 6 feet under.</p>
				<p>In Part 2 of our 3-part series, Fogarty takes us on a tour of The Fogarty Institute for Innovation, affectionately known as "The Fog Shop."</p>

              	<p>Five startups have been selected to join the incubator program at The Fogarty Institute, an education nonprofit based in Mountain Valley, Calif., that mentors medical innovators.</p>
				<p>Four out of five of these companies–First Pulse Medical, Materna Medical, InPress Technologies and Medical Cue–are attempting to innovate in the maternity/women’s health field.</p>
				<p>President and CEO Ann Fyfe said this is a growing trend, as lots of innovations need to be made but haven’t been, partially due to an environment surrounded by litigation that makes innovators and investors nervous.</p>
				<p>The other one, Prescient Surgical, has two buzz words associated with it: readmissions and wound healing. Fyfe said the woundcare field is growing quickly, especially for those products intended to reduce hospital-acquired infections (in theory limiting hospital stays and readmissions).</p>

					<h3>Making pregnancy safer, one medtech start-up at a time</h3>

              	<p>Not every 79-year-old surgeon happens to run a tech incubator. Not every 79-year-old surgeon who runs a tech incubator happens to have a winery either. But Thomas Fogarty does. The doctor-entrepreneur-vintner, best known for inventing the angioplasty balloon, runs the Thomas Fogarty Winery just a few miles uphill from his medtech incubator at El Camino Hospital in Mountain View.</p>
				<p>The non-profit Fogarty Institute for Innovation is based around a simple concept: Making life easier for small or early stage medtech firms developing cutting-edge products or tools. In an interview with Fast Company, Fogarty decried what he saw as the increasing cost of American medical innovation, and said that small medical companies need a safe environment for growth similar to those of lower-overhead conventional tech startups.</p>
